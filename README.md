# MTG Card Extension

A quick Chrome extension to store Magic: The Gathering cards for later use later.

Often times, in order to add cards to my deck lists I need to open the card in a new tab to add. Instead, this extension
allows for easy storing so that the deck list can be copy-pasted later.

## Accessing the extension

- Bam! You're loaded.
